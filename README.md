# Quantum Physics II (PY 452) Fall 2022 Discussion Materials

All of the discussion materials are also on GitHub at [https://github.com/emmyb-bu/PY-452-Fall-2022-Discussion-Materials](<https://github.com/emmyb-bu/PY-452-Fall-2022-Discussion-Materials>).

These are the discussion materials that were used in the Fall 2022 iteration of PY 452 taught by Anatoli Polkovnikov.
These materials were created by Emmy Blumenthal and may be useful for the course taught in future semester.

### Notes and worked examples for the following topics are included:
- [Symmetries and time averaging](<Symmetries and time-averaging>) includes a [*Mathematica* notebook](<Symmetries and time-averaging/TimeAveraging.nb>) which demonstrates time-averaging of a particle in an infinite square well.
- [Equivalence of the first and second quantizations](<Equivalence of 1st and 2nd Quantizations/PY452-09-28.pdf>)
- [Perturbation theory applied to the quantum harmonic oscillator](<Perturbing the QHO/Perturbing the QHO.pdf>)
- [Degenerate perturbation theory for the isotropic 2D quantum harmonic oscillator](<Perturbing the Isotropic 2D QHO/Perturbing-2DQHO.pdf>)
- [Degenerate perturbation theory for spin systems](<Degenerate Perturbation Thoery and the Radial Equation/Degenerate-and-Radial.pdf>)
- [Variational method for the hydrogen atom](<Hydrogen Variational Method/Hydrogen Variatioal Method.pdf>); there is also a [*Jupyter* notebook](<Hydrogen Variational Method/variational_excited_states.ipynb>) written in *Julia* that demonstrates how to compute excited states using the variational method and constrained optimization.
- [Using the radial equation in the context of the variational method](<Degenerate Perturbation Thoery and the Radial Equation/Degenerate-and-Radial.pdf>)
- [Variational method for the Yukawa potential and the effect of system size for exact diagonalization](<Yukawa and rmax>)---this interactive demonstration was written in *Julia* in the format of a *Pluto* notebook. A [video recording](<Yukawa and rmax/Yukawa-interactivity-recording.mp4>) of the interactive notebook is included.
- [WKB approximation for the 'triangle potential'](<WKB Triangle Potential/WKB-Triangle.pdf>); also includes a [*Mathematica* notebook](<WKB Triangle Potential/WKBexact.nb>) which compares the WKB approximation to the exact solution.
- [WKB approximation for the 'quantum bouncing ball'](<WKB Bouncing Ball/WKB-Bouncing-Ball.pdf>) and [*Mathematica* notebook](<WKB Bouncing Ball/plotting.nb>) show how to implement the patching region for the WKB wavefunction
- [Animations comparing tunneling phenomena in the classical and quantum cases](<Classical vs Quantum Tunneling Animation>)---this interactive demonstration was written in *Julia* in the format of a *Pluto* notebook. A [video recording](<Classical vs Quantum Tunneling Animation/tunneling-interactivity.mp4>) of the interactive notebook is included.
- [Time-dependent perturbation theory](<Time-dependent perturbations/Time-dependent_perturbations.pdf>)
- [Fermi's golden rule for a particle in the $\delta$-potential](<FGR delta potential/FGR_delta_potential.pdf>)

In addition to these notes, a [report](<Survey and report/LA_project_essay.pdf>) and [spreadsheet](<Survey and report/PY452 Discussion Content Evaluation (Responses).xlsx>) are included which summarize the results of a survey of the students in the course.
This survey, motivated by the [SED SC 521](<https://www.bu.edu/academics/wheelock/courses/sed-sc-521/>) course, was conducted in order to assess the effectiveness of the discussion materials.
